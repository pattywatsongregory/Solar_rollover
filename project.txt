Multiple panels can be wired together to produce more power. Each panel has an individual power rating, in Watts (W). To find the total size of the solar system in kilowatts (kW), multiply the power rating of the panels by the total number of panels and divide by 1,000.   Example  A solar system of 31 panels that are 400 W each is 12.4 kW.   31 x 400 W = 12.4 kW     1000 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Generation_meter","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Generation_meter","title":"Generation Meter  Also called a “production meter,” this monitors the power generated by the solar system. This is unrelated to the electric meter already on the house. Now, these are usually digital displays that can track power generation at the instant as well as over time. Many are now Wi-Fi enabled so can report production data to an app or website.  For systems that are “solar plus storage”, the electricity may go to a battery system at this point. ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Generation_meter_4","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Generation_meter_4","title":"AC Disconnect Switch  This is an important safety component that allows homeowners or electrical crews to disconnect the solar production system from the electrical grid. It is always on the exterior of the house and must be easily accessible to electrical crews.  From here, the electricity generated by the solar panels goes into the house through the breaker panel. It can power any household electronics. Just like electricity from the power company, the breaker panel can be used to turn on or off electricity to the different parts of the house.  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Generation_meter_5","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Generation_meter_5","title":"Advanced Electric Meter  These meters track any surplus electricity generated by the solar system that goes to the electrical grid as well as electricity from the grid used by the household, allowing “net metering.”  In net metering, the utility company buys any electricity generated above and beyond what the household uses. In most cases, the utility company provides a credit for any surplus power generated rather than paying a monetary payment. This allows solar customer to use credits from surplus electricity generated to reduce the cost of electricity bills when solar generation is lower. ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Rollover_Caption_2","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Rollover_Caption_2","title":"Inverter  Solar panels produce electricity in the form of direct current (DC), similar to a battery. Electricity from your power company is in the form of alternating current (AC). The inverter converts the DC electricity from the solar panels to AC that household appliances can use.   Solar inverters can be mounted on the exterior of the house, as shown here, or each solar panel can have a microinverter attached to the panel itself.
